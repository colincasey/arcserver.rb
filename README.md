# Arcserver.rb

Arcserver.rb is an interface for interacting with ESRI ArcGIS Server  REST APIs from Ruby.

## Installation

    [sudo] gem install arcserver.rb

If you want to use it in with Bundler add to your Gemfile

    gem 'arcserver.rb', '~> 0.1.5'

## Quick Example

    require 'arcserver'

Connect to a map server instance using either its REST url

    map_server = ArcServer::MapServer.new('http://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/services/Portland/ESRI_LandBase_WebMercator/MapServer')

and export an image 

    puts map_server.export

Query for retreive some features, the result will be a FeatureSet, which is a wrapper for the layer information and the features found

    query = ArcServer::REST::Query.new({ where: "district='4'", outFields: "*" })
    feature_set = query.execute('0', "http://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/SanFrancisco/311Incidents/FeatureServer")

    puts feature_set.features

Or directly within a MapServer or FeatureServer and his Layer number

    feature_server = ArcServer::FeatureServer.new("http://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/SanFrancisco/311Incidents/FeatureServer")
    feature_set = feature_server.query('0', { where: "district='Lugano'", outFields: "*" })

Query is possible in different ways, like through geometry

    feature_server = ArcServer::FeatureServer.new("http://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/SanFrancisco/311Incidents/FeatureServer")
    feature_set = feature_server.query('0', { geometryType: 'esriGeometryEnvelope', geometry: '{"xmin":997878.8354556253,"ymin":5783588.635939264,"xmax":998147.5593831083,"ymax":5783767.785224252,"spatialReference":{"wkid":102100}}', outFields: "*", inSR: 102100, outSR: 102100 })

    puts feature_set.features

An Identify operation is a query but applied to all layers in the MapServer

    map_server = ArcServer::MapServer.new("http://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Specialty/ESRI_StateCityHighway_USA/MapServer")
    results = map_server.identify({ geometryType: "esriGeometryPoint", geometry: "-120,40", tolerance: "10", mapExtent: "-119,38,-121,41", imageDisplay: "400,300,96" })

    puts results # each results has its own feature and metadata

A feature is a simple class with Geometry and attributes, create one is easy

    f = ArcServer::Graphics::Feature.new({ geometry: { x: 997986.5006082746, y: 5783631.06234916, spatialReference: { wkid: 102100 }}, attributes: {status:1,req_id:"12345",req_type:"Graffiti Complaint â€“ Private Property",req_date:"30.09.2013",req_time:"14:00",address:"via dei matti 0",district:"4"} })

Once you have a feature, it's ready to be saved on a feature layer

    fs = ArcServer::FeatureServer.new("http://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/SanFrancisco/311Incidents/FeatureServer")

    results = fs.applyEdits([ f ], [ ], [  ]) # adds, updates, deletes

You can simply edit a feature if you have an objectId, maybe retrieved with a Query

    f = ArcServer::Graphics::Feature.new({ attributes: { objectId: 12345, address: "via dei matti 0", district: "4"} })

    results = fs.applyEdits([ ], [ f ], [  ]) # adds, updates, deletes

If you'd like to hack on arcserver.rb, start by forking my repo on GitHub:

  http://github.com/lukefx/arcserver.rb

To get all of the dependencies, install the gem first. The best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:

1. Clone your fork
2. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
3. Hack away
4. Add tests and make sure everything still passes by running rake
5. If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README
6. Do not change the version number, I will do that on my end
7. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
8. Push the branch up to GitHub
9. Send me a pull request for your branch
