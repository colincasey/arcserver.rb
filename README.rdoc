SOAP and REST APIs from Ruby.  Extra utility methods are also provided for
generating legend images.

  # connect to a map server instance using either its REST or SOAP url
  map_server = ArcServer::MapServer.new('http://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/services/Portland/ESRI_LandBase_WebMercator/MapServer')

  # get the default map name using the SOAP API
  puts map_server.get_default_map_name
